Pack up R to take away

This is a fairly thin wrapper around some of the functions in [`provisionr`](https://github.com/richfitz/provisionr) but aimed at making it easy to create an internally consistent set of R packages, along with R itself, Rstudio, and on windows Rtools and git.  Non-CRAN packages are supported.  Configuration is via a simple yml file; see [`inst/nomad.yml`](inst/nomad.yml) for an annoted example.
